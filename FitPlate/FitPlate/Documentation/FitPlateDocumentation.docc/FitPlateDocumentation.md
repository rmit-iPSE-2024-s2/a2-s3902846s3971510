# ``FitPlate``

## Overview

FitPlate is a simple fitness tracking app built using SwiftUI and SwiftData. It allows users to sign up, log in, edit their profiles, and set personal fitness goals such as step goal completion and water intake goals.

- Recipe generation with filters via external API.
- Fitness goal tracking (steps, calories, water intake).
- Saved workout routines.
- Profile management and editing.
- A widget displays that saved workout routines.
