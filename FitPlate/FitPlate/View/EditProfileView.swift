 The `EditProfileView` allows users to update their profile details, including username, fitness goals, goal weight, calories, and step goals.
 
 Users can either edit an existing profile or create a new one if they have not already. When Edit Profile is selected,  it provides  a form-based layout with text fields, steppers, and pickers for input.
 
 The profile information is stored using SwiftData, and the view provides feedback to the user when the profile is successfully updated.
